        <h3><blockquote>Notable Timeline of Elon Musk</blockquote></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>2022: Twitter</strong>
                After buying up enough stock to make him a majority shareholder by April 1, Musk made the move to
                purchase Twitter for $44 billion at the end of April. His plans include making Twitter “better than
                ever” by “enhancing the product with new features, making the
                algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <strong>2016: The Boring Company</strong>
                Founded with the intention of helping dispel city traffic via underground tunnels as a subsidiary of
                SpaceX, the Boring Company is one of Musk’s side projects. Its aim: build tunnels. They first
                experimented by tunneling under the SpaceX factory in California. The Boring Company became an
                independent entity in 2018, and in 2021 completed a tunnel project in Las Vegas to shuttle visitors
                beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center. It is currently working on further tunnel projects in Las Vegas
                for underground transport. Other projects are primarily speculative.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <strong>2016: Neuralink</strong>
                Another research endeavor, Musk co-founded Neuralink in 2016 with the goal of working on “brain-machine
                interfaces,” or BMIs, that can be implanted directly into the body. Neuroscientists have been skeptical
                of Neuralink’s research and claims. While they currently conduct experiments on animals, they moved
                plans to begin working on human subjects to 2022.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <strong>2015: OpenAI</strong>
                Musk co-founded OpenAI as a non-profit in 2015, with a for-profit artificial intelligence research lab
                component; it was started with a $1 billion collective pledge from its founders. Musk has been open
                about his interest in developing “friendly” AI that supports humanity.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <strong>2006: SolarCity</strong>
                Founded by his cousins in 2006, SolarCity received Musk’s patronage from the offset; he was their
                primary financial backer. A solar energy company that became the leading residential solar installer in
                the U.S. by the mid-2010s, SolarCity installed solar energy systems that were leased to residential
                users. Musk, via Tesla, acquired SolarCity in 2016 for $2.6 billion in stock and incorporated it into
                its operations as Tesla Energy.


            </li><br>

            <li>
                <strong>2004: Tesla</strong>
                These days, Musk is perhaps best known for his leadership at Tesla, the electric car company named after
                famed inventor Nikola Tesla. Valued at over $1 trillion at one point in 2021, Tesla was founded in 2003
                by two other men; Musk entered a Series A funding round with an investment of $6.5 million, and
                eventually took an increasingly active role in the company. He has been CEO since 2008. The Model 3 is
                the most popular electric car in production today, with over one million units sold globally.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <strong>2002: The Musk Foundation</strong>
                Founded as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, the Musk Foundation is one of Musk's least-talked-about
                endeavors. Its stated goals including supporting renewable energy and pediatric research and education,
                and the developing of “safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.” Between 2002 and 2018 it
                handed out around $25 million, about half of that to OpenAI, a company owned by Musk himself. (Since
                2012, Musk has also been a signatory of The Giving Pledge, in which many of the world's richest people
                have committed to giving away the majority of their wealth at some point.)
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <strong>2002: SpaceX</strong>
                Musk next set his sights on a lofty goal: space exploration, and the future colonization Mars. In the
                past 20 years, SpaceX has dealt with a series of rocket launch failures and Starship explosions. But it
                has also become a heavy-hitter in the space industry with a number of records to its name, including
                being the first private company to send a craft to the International Space Station and send astronauts
                to orbit. It is known for its reusable rockets.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <strong>1999: X.com</strong>
                Musk invested some of his windfall from the Zip2 sale into his next venture: X.com, an online bank,
                launched with three other co-founders. X.com’s business model was innovative for its time, in that it
                incentivized sign-ups and eased the process of transferring funds digitally, with no need for mail or
                traditional banking infrastructure.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <strong>1995: Zip2</strong>
                Along with his brother, Musk founded Zip2, an online business directory, as an online alternative to the
                standard paper yellow pages. (Google would not launch until 1998.) He sold it for over $300 million in
                1999 to Compaq Computer Corporation. Musk was ousted as CEO in 1996, however, when the board of
                directors decided to install a more experienced leader in his stead.
